# Audio-Predictor
Predicts short missing audio segments of songs. This is an updated version of Fourier Predicter created by Professor Marco Gori, University of Siena.

The files within this folder are:

- Audio_with_missing_segment_.m4a : This is the audio file that has a missing segment at around 4 second mark. It is used as an input for the Fourier_Audio_Predictor.py file.

- Fourier_Audio_Predictor.py : Is the main py file that contains the algorithm used for this project.

- STFT_Analysis.py : Is the py file that is used to extract the spectrograms of the outputs of the Fourier predictor.
